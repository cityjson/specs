== CityJSON Object

A CityJSON object represents one 3D city model of a given area, this
model may contain features of different types, as defined in the CityGML
data model.

A CityJSON object:

* is a JSON object.
* must have the following 4 members:
[arabic]
. one member with the name `"type"`, whose value must be `"CityJSON"`;
. one member with the name `"version"`, whose value must be a string
with the version (X.Y) of CityJSON used. Observe that while schemas can
have a version with patch version (X.Y.Z), a CityJSON object points only
to the minor version (X.Y), and for validation the latest schema of that
minor version should be used.
. one member with the name `"CityObjects"`. The value of this member is
a collection of key-value pairs, where the key is the ID of the object,
and the value is one City Object. The ID of a City Object should be
unique (within one CityJSON Object).
. one member with the name `"vertices"`, whose value is an array of
coordinates of each vertex of the city model. Their position in this
array (0-based) is used as an index to be referenced by the Geometric
Objects. The indexing mechanism of the format
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file[Wavefront OBJ] is
basically reused.
* may have one member with the name `"extensions"`, which is used if
there are <<Extensions>> used in the file.
* may have one member with the name `"metadata"`, whose value may be a
JSON object describing the coordinate reference system used, the extent
of the dataset, its creator, etc.
* may have one member with the name `"transform"`, whose value if a JSON
object describing how to _decompress_ the coordinates. Transform is used
to reduce the file size only.
* may have one member with the name `"appearance"`, the value may
contain JSON objects representing the textures and/or materials of
surfaces.
* may have one member with the name `"geometry-templates"`, the value is
a JSON object containing the templates that can be reused by different
City Objects (usually for trees). This is equivalent to the concept of
"implicit geometries" in CityGML.
* may have other members, and their value is not prescribed. Because
these are not standard in CityJSON, they might be ignored by parsers.

The minimal valid CityJSON object is thus:

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "CityJSON",
  "version": "1.0",
  "CityObjects": {},
  "vertices": []
}
----

An "empty" CityJSON object will look like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "CityJSON",
  "version": "1.0",
  "extensions": {},
  "metadata": {},
  "transform": {
    "scale": [],
    "translate": []
  },
  "CityObjects": {},
  "vertices": [],
  "appearance": {},
  "geometry-templates": {}
}
----

[NOTE]
While the order of the member values of a CityJSON should
preferably be as above, not all JSON generators allow one to do this,
thus the order is not prescribed.

== City Object

A City Object is a JSON object for which the type memberâ€™s value is one
of the following (of type string):

image::figs/co.svg[]

There are 2 kinds of City Objects, this is because the schema of CityGML
has been flattened out. Both types are represented as a City Object in a
CityJSON Object.

[arabic]
. *1st-level*: City Objects that can "exist by themselves".
. *2nd-level*: City Objects that need to have a `"parents"` to exist.

For example, a `"BuildingInstallation"` cannot be present in a dataset
without being the `"children"` of a `"Building"`, but a `"Building"` can
be present by itself.

A City Object:

* must have one member with the name `"geometry"`, whose value is an
array containing 0 or more Geometry Objects. More than one Geometry
Object is used to represent several different levels-of-detail (LoDs)
for the same object. However, the different Geometry Objects of a given
City Object do not have be of different LoDs.
* may have one member with the name `"attributes"`, whose value is an
object with the different attributes allowed by CityGML.
* may have one member with the name `"geographicalExtent"` (the
axis-aligned bounding box of the City Object), whose value is an array
with 6 values: `[minx, miny, minz, maxx, maxy, maxz]`
* may have one member `"children"`, which consists of an array of the
IDs (of type string) of the 2nd-level City Objects that are part of the
City Object. A City Object can have different types of City Objects as
children, eg a `"Building"` can have both as children `"BuildingPart"`
and `"BuildingInstallation"`. The order of the children in the array is
not relevant.
* of type 2nd-level must have one member `"parents"`, which consists of
an array of the IDs (of type string) of the City Objects that are its
parents. For the City Objects in the core module of CityJSON, this array
will always be of size 1 (only one parent). New City Objects defined in
extensions can have more than one parents. Notice that a 2nd-level City
Object may also have one member `"children"`, and that the `"children"`
array only references the City Objects that are one level below the the
current one in the hierarchy. For instance a `"BuildingPart"` that
contains a `"BuildingInstallation"`.

[source,json]
----
"CityObjects": {
  "id-1": {
    "type": "Building",
    "geographicalExtent": [ 84710.1, 446846.0, -5.3, 84757.1, 446944.0, 40.9 ], 
    "attributes": { 
      "measuredHeight": 22.3,
      "roofType": "gable roof",
      "owner": "Elvis Presley"
    },
    "children": ["id-2"],
    "geometry": [{...}]
  },
  "id-2": {
    "type": "BuildingPart",

    "children": ["id-3"],
    ...
  },
  "id-3": {

    "parents": ["id-2"],
    ...
  },
  "id-4": {
    "type": "LandUse", 
    ...
  }
}
----

A minimal valid City Object (`"Building"` in this case, but any
1st-level could apply) is:

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "Building", 
  "geometry": []
}
----

And a minimal 2nd-level valid City Object (`"BuildingPart"` in this
case, but any 2nd-level could apply) is:

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "BuildingPart", 
  "parents": ["id-parent"],
  "geometry": []
}
----

=== Attributes

The attributes prescribed by CityGML differ per City Object, and can be
seen either in the
https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=47842[official
CityGML documentation v2.0.0] or in the schemas of CityJSON.

In CityJSON, any other attributes not prescribed by the CityGML data
model can be added with a JSON key-value pair ("owner" in the example
above is one such attribute) in the `"attributes"` of a City Object.

All the City Objects have the following 3 possible attributes:

[arabic]
. `"class"`
. `"function"`
. `"usage"`

While CityGML does not prescribe the values for these, the Annex C of
the https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=47842[official
CityGML documentation v2.0.0] provides code lists that can be used. In
CityJSON, as can be seen in the schemas, the values should be a string,
thus either the name of the values should be used, or the code as a
string:

[source,json]
----
"CityObjects": {
  "id-1": {
    "type": "LandUse", 
    "attributes": { 
      "function": "Industry and Business"
    },
    "geometry": [{...}]
  },
  "id-2": {
    "type": "WaterBody", 
    "attributes": { 
      "class": "1010"
    },
    "geometry": [{...}]
  }
}
----

=== Building

Three City Objects are related to buildings: `"Building"`,
`"BuildingPart"`, and `"BuildingInstallation"`.

The geometry of both `"Building"` and `"BuildingPart"` can only be
represented with these Geometry Objects: (1) `"Solid"`, (2)
`"CompositeSolid"`, (3) `"MultiSurface"`.

The geometry of a `"BuildingInstallation"` object can be represented
with any of the Geometry Objects.

A City Object of type `"Building"` or `"BuildingPart"` may have a member
`"address"`, whose value is a JSON object describing the address. One
location (a `"MultiPoint"`) can be given, for instance to position the
front door inside the building.

As is the case in CityGML, the address information is specified using
the http://xml.coverpages.org/xnal.html[xAL address standard].

[source,json]
----
"CityObjects": {
  "id-1": {
    "type": "Building", 
    "attributes": { 
      "roofType": "gable roof"
    },
    "geographicalExtent": [ 84710.1, 446846.0, -5.3, 84757.1, 446944.0, 40.9 ],
    "children": ["id-56", "id-832", "mybalcony"]
  },
  "id-56": {
    "type": "BuildingPart", 
    "parents": ["id-1"],
    ...
  },
  "mybalcony": {
    "type": "BuildingInstallation", 
    "parents": ["id-1"],
    ...
  }
}
----

    "ThoroughfareNumber": "1",
    "ThoroughfareName": "rue de la Patate",
    "PostalCode": "H0H 0H0"
  }
}
----

=== Transportation

CityJSON uses 3 classes related to transportation (`"Road"`,
`"Railway"`, `"TransportSquare"`) and omits the "Track" from CityGML
because it simply can be a road with specific attributes.
`"TransportSquare"` is used to model for instance parking lots and
squares.

In CityGML, each of the 3 classes can have a number of "TrafficArea"
and "AuxiliaryTrafficArea", which are defined as new surfaces. In
CityJSON, these surfaces do not need to be defined again since the road
surfaces become Semantic Surface Objects (with type `"TrafficArea"` or
`"AuxiliaryTrafficArea"`). That is, the surface representing a road
should be split into sub-surfaces (therefore forming a `"MultiSurface"`
or a `"CompositeSurface"`), and each of the sub-surfaces has semantics.

The geometry of a City Object of type `"Road"`, `"Railway"`,
`"TransportSquare"` can be of types `"MultiSurface"`,
`"CompositeSurface"` or `"MultiLineString"`.

[source,json]

        "function": "road"
      }
    ],
    "values": [0, 1, null, 2]
  }
}
----

=== TINRelief

The geometry of a City Object of type `"TINRelief"` can only be of type
`"CompositeSurface"`.

CityJSON does not define a specific Geometry Object for a TIN
(triangulated irregular network), it is simply a CompositeSurface for
which every surface is a triangle (thus a polygon having 3 vertices, and
no interior ring).

Notice that in practice any `"CompositeSurface"` is allowed for encoding
a terrain, and that arbitrary polygons could also be used (not just
triangles).

      ]  
    ]
  }]    
}

of the following: `"MultiPoint"`, `"MultiLineString"`, `"MultiSurface"`,
`"CompositeSurface"`, `"Solid"`, or `"CompositeSolid"`.

    ]
  }]
}
----

=== Bridge

Four City Objects are related to bridges: `"Bridge"`, `"BridgePart"`,
`"BridgeInstallation"`, and `"BridgeConstructionElement"`.

The geometry of both `"Bridge"` and `"BridgePart"` can only be
represented with these Geometry Objects: (1) `"Solid"`, (2)
`"CompositeSolid"`, (3) `"MultiSurface"`.

The geometry of a `"BridgeInstallation"` or
`"BridgeConstructionElement"` object can be represented with any of the
Geometry Objects.

A City Object of type `"Bridge"` or `"BridgePart"` may have a member
`"address"`, whose value is a JSON object describing the address. One
location (a `"MultiPoint"`) can be given, for instance to locate the
front door inside the building.

[source,json]

      ]
    }]    
  }
}
----

=== Tunnel

Three City Objects are related to tunnels: `"Tunnel"`, `"TunnelPart"`,
and `"TunnelInstallation"`.

The geometry of both `"Tunnel"` and `"TunnelPart"` can only be
represented with these Geometry Objects: (1) `"Solid"`, (2)
`"CompositeSolid"`, (3) `"MultiSurface"`.

The geometry of a `"TunnelInstallation"` object can be represented with
any of the Geometry Objects.

[source,json]
----
"CityObjects": {

    "type": "Tunnel", 
    "attributes": { 
      "yearOfConstruction": 2000,

    },
    "children": ["stoparea1"],
    "geometry": [{
      "type": "Solid",
      "lod": 2,
      "boundaries": [
        [ [[0, 3, 2, 1]], [[4, 5, 6, 7]], [[0, 1, 5, 4]] ]
      ]
    }] 
  }
}
----

=== CityObjectGroup

The CityGML concept of _groups_, where City Objects are aggregated based
on certain criteria (think of a neighbourhood for instance), is possible
in CityJSON. As in CityGML, the group is a City Object, and it can
contain, if needed, a geometry (the polygon representing the
neighbourhood for instance).

A City Object of type `"CityObjectGroup"` must have a member
`"members"`, whose value is an array of the IDs of the City Objects that
the group contains. Since a `"CityObjectGroup"` is also a City Object,
it can be part of another group.

[source,json]
----
"CityObjects": {
  "my-neighbourhood": {
    "type": "CityObjectGroup",
    "members": ["building1", "building2", "building666"]
  }
}
----

As for other City Objects, a City Object of type `"CityObjectGroup"` may
have a member `"geometry"`, although only one geometry is allowed in the
array of geometries. The `"lod"` property is rather meaningless, but is
used to enforce uniformity with all the other geometries. This geometry
could for instance be used to represent the boundary of a neighbourhood
in a city, and each building in it is listed in the group.

[source,json]
----
"CityObjects": {
  "my-neighbourhood": {
    "type": "CityObjectGroup",
    "members": ["building1", "building2"],
    "geometry": [{
      "type": "MultiSurface",
      "lod": 2,
      "boundaries": [ [[2, 4, 5]] ]
    }]
  }
}
----

== Geometry Objects

CityJSON defines the following 3D geometric primitives, all of which are
embedded in 3D space (and therefore their vertices have _(x, y, z)_
coordinates). The indexing mechanism of the format
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file[Wavefront OBJ] is
reused, that is a geometry does not store the locations of its vertices,
but points to a vertex in a list (property `"vertices"` in the CityJSON
Object).

As is the case in CityGML, only linear and planar primitives are
allowed; no curves or parametric surfaces can be represented.

A Geometry object is a JSON object for which the type memberâ€™s value is
one of the following:

[arabic]
. `"MultiPoint"`
. `"MultiLineString"`
. `"MultiSurface"`
. `"CompositeSurface"`
. `"Solid"`
. `"MultiSolid"`
. `"CompositeSolid"`
. `"GeometryInstance"` (this is another type with different properties,
see <<Geometry templates>>)

A Geometry object:

* must have one member with the name `"lod"`, whose value is a number
identifying the level-of-detail (LoD) of the geometry. This can be
either an integer (following the CityGML standards), or a number
following the https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/lod[improved LoDs by TU Delft]
* must have one member with the name `"boundaries"`, whose value is a
hierarchy of arrays (the depth depends on the Geometry object) with
integers. An integer refers to the index in the `"vertices"` array of
the CityJSON object, and it is 0-based (ie the first element in the
array has the index "0", the second one "1", etc.).
* may have one member `"semantics"`, whose value is a JSON Object, as
defined below.
* may have one member `"material"`, whose value is a JSON Object, as
defined below.
* may have one member `"texture"`, whose value is a JSON Object, as
defined below.

[NOTE]
There is _no_ Geometry Object for MultiGeometry. Instead, for the
`"geometry"` member of a CityObject, the different geometries may be
enumerated in the array (all with the same value for the member
`"lod"`).

=== The coordinates of the vertices

A CityJSON must have one member named `"vertices"`, whose value is an
array of coordinates of each vertex of the city model. Their position in
this array (0-based) is used to represent the Geometric Objects.

* one vertex must be an array with exactly 3 values, representing the
_(x,y,z)_ location of the vertex.
* the array of vertices may be empty.
* vertices may be repeated

[source,json]
----
"vertices": [
  [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
  [1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
  [0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
  ...
  [1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
  [8523.134, 487625.134, 2.03]
]
----

=== Arrays to represent boundaries

The depth of the hierarchy of arrays depends on the Geometry object, and
is as follows.

* A `"MultiPoint"` has an array with the indices of the vertices; this
array can be empty.
* A `"MultiLineString"` has an array of arrays, each containing the
indices of a LineString
* A `"MultiSurface"`, or a `"CompositeSurface"`, has an array containing
surfaces, each surface is modelled by an array of array, the first array
being the exterior boundary of the surface, and the others the interior
boundaries.
* A `"Solid"` has an array of shells, the first array being the exterior
shell of the solid, and the others the interior shells. Each shell has
an array of surfaces, modelled in the exact same way as a
MultiSurface/CompositeSurface.
* A `"MultiSolid"`, or a `"CompositeSolid"`, has an array containing
solids, each solid is modelled as above.

[NOTE]
JSON does not allow comments, the comments in the example below
(C++ style: `//-- my comments`) are only to explain the cases, and
should be removed.

=== Semantics of geometric primitives

A Semantic Object is a JSON object representing the semantics of a
primitive of a geometry (e.g.Â a surface of a building). It may also
represent other attributes of the primitive (e.g.Â the slope of the roof
or the solar potential). For surfacic and volumetric geometries
(e.g.Â `MultiSurface`, `Solid` and `MultiSolid`), a primitive is a
surface. If a geometry is a `MultiPoint` or a `MultiLineString`, then
the primitives are its respective sub-parts: points and linestrings.

A Semantic Object:

* must have one member with the name `"type"`, whose value is one of the
allowed value. These depend on the City Object, see below.
* may have an attribute `"parent"`, whose value is an integer pointing
to another Semantic Object of the same geometry (index of it, 0-based).
This is used to explicitly represent to which wall or roof a window or
door belongs to; there can be only one parent.
* may have an attribute `"children"`, whose value is an array of
integers pointing to other Semantic Objects of the same geometry (index
of it, 0-based). This is used to explicitly represent the openings
(windows and doors) of walls and roofs.
* may have other attributes in the form of a JSON key-value pair, where
the value must not be a JSON object (but a
string/number/integer/boolean).

  "type": "RoofSurface",
  "slope": 16.4,
  "children": [2, 37],
  "solar-potential": 5
}

{
  "type": "Window",
  "parent": 2,
  "type-glass": "HR++"
}
----

`"Building"`, `"BuildingPart"`, and `"BuildingInstallation"` can have
the following semantics (for LoD0 to LoD3; LoD4 is omitted):

* `"RoofSurface"`
* `"GroundSurface"`
* `"WallSurface"`
* `"ClosureSurface"`
* `"OuterCeilingSurface"`
* `"OuterFloorSurface"`
* `"Window"`
* `"Door"`

For `"WaterBody"`:

* `"WaterSurface"`
* `"WaterGroundSurface"`
* `"WaterClosureSurface"`

For Transportation (`"Road"`, `"Railway"`, `"TransportSquare"`):

* `"TrafficArea"`
* `"AuxiliaryTrafficArea"`

Because in one given City Object (say a `"Building"`) several primitives
can have the same semantics (think of a complex building that has been
triangulated, there can be dozens of triangles used to model the same
surface), a Semantic Object has to be declared once, and each of the
primitives that are represented by it points to it. This is achieved by
first declaring all the Semantic Objects in an array, and then having an
array where each primitive links to Semantic Objects (position in the
array).

A Geometry object:

* may have one member with the name `"semantics"`, whose values are two
properties: `"surfaces"` and `"values"`. Both have to be present.
* the value of `"surfaces"` is an array of Semantic Objects.
* the value of `"values"` is a hierarchy of arrays with integers. The
depth depends on the Geometry object: for `MultiPoint` and
`MultiLineString` this is a simple array of integers; for any other
geometry type it is two less than the array `"boundaries"`. An integer
refers to the index in the `"surfaces"` array of the same geometry, and
it is 0-based. If one surface has no semantics, a value of `null` must
be used.

[NOTE]
*CAUTION:* For legacy reasons, we use `"surfaces"` to name the
array of Semantic Object. Nevertheless, this property is used for points
and linestrings of `MultiPoints` and `MultiLineStrings`, as well.

[NOTE]
A `null` value is used to specify that a given surface has no
semantics, but to avoid having arrays filled with `null`, it is also
possible to specify `null` for a shell or a whole Solid in a MultiSolid,
the `null` propagates to the nested arrays.

=== Geometry templates

CityGMLâ€™s Implicit Geometries, better known in computer graphics as
_templates_, are one method to compress files since the geometries (such
as benches, lamp posts, and trees), need only be defined once. In
CityJSON, they are implemented differently from what is specified in
CityGML: they are defined separately in the file, and each template can
be reused. By contrast, in CityGML, the geometry used for a given City
Object is reused by other City Objects, there is thus no central
location where all templates are stored.

The Geometry Templates are defined as a JSON object that:

* must have one member with the name `"templates"`, whose value is an
array of Geometry Objects.
* must have one member with the name `"vertices-templates"`, whose value
is an array of coordinates of each vertex of the templates (0-based
indexing). The reason the vertices index are not global is to ensure
that operations on the vertices (eg for CRS transformation, for
<<Transform Object>>, or calculating the bounding box of a dataset)
will not be affected by the templates (since they will often be defined
locally, and translated/rotated/scaled to their final position).

[source,json]
----
"geometry-templates": {
  "templates": [
    {
      "type": "MultiSurface",
      "lod": 2,
      "boundaries": [

    ...
    [1.0, 1.0, 0.0],
    [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
  ]
}
----

A given template can be used as the geometry (or as one of the
geometries) of a City Object. A new JSON object of type
`"GeometryInstance"` is defined, and it:

* must have one member with the name `"template"`, whose value is the
position of the template in the `"geometry-templates"` (0-indexing).
* must have one member with the name `"boundaries"`, whose value is an
array containing only one vertex index, which refers to one vertex in
the `"vertices"` property of a CityJSON file. (This is the reference
point from which the transformations are applied, it is the
"referencePoint" in CityGML.)
* must have one member with the name `"transformationMatrix"`, whose
value is a 4x4 matrix (thus 16 values in an array) defining the the
rotation/translation/scaling of the template (as defined in the CityGML
2.0.0 documentation).

}

[NOTE]
The CityJSON website has a
https://www.cityjson.org/help/dev/realcoords/[page to help developers to
calculate coordinates] for Geometry Templates and other Geometry
Objects.

== Transform Object

To reduce the size of a CityJSON object (and thus the size of files), it
is possible to represent the coordinates of the vertices with integer
values, and store the scale factor and the translation needed to obtain
the original coordinates (stored with floats/doubles). To use
compression, a CityJSON object may have one member `"transform"`, whose
values are 2 mandatory JSON objects (`"scale"` and `"translate"`), both
arrays with 3 values.

The
https://github.com/topojson/topojson-specification/blob/master/README.md#212-transforms[scheme
of TopoJSON (called quantization)] is reused, and here we simply add a
third coordinate because our vertices are embedded in 3D space.

If a CityJSON object has a member `"transform"`, then only the
`"vertices"` at the root of the CityJSON object are affected, the
vertices for the Geometric templates and textures are not.

To obtain the real position of a given vertex _v_, we must take the 3
values _vi_ listed in the `"vertices"` member and:

....
v[0] = (vi[0] * ["transform"]["scale"][0]) + ["transform"]["translate"][0]
v[1] = (vi[1] * ["transform"]["scale"][1]) + ["transform"]["translate"][1]
v[2] = (vi[2] * ["transform"]["scale"][2]) + ["transform"]["translate"][2]
....

If the CityJSON file does not have a `"transform"` member, then the
values of the vertices must be read as-is.

    "scale": [0.01, 0.01, 0.01],
    "translate": [4424648.79, 5482614.69, 310.19]
}
----

== Metadata

The metadata related to the 3D city model may be stored in a JSON object
that may have different members, as follows. Many of the members in
https://www.iso.org/standard/53798.html[ISO19115] are used, and a few
are added because they are useful in 3D in a city modelling context (eg
`"presentLoDs"` and `"thematicModels"`). To see all the possible ones,
look at the schema file
https://3d.bk.tudelft.nl/schemas/cityjson/[metadata.schema.json] of a
given version.

=== CRS

The coordinate reference system (CRS) may be given as a string.
http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogcna/[OGC CRS URNs] such as
`"urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::7415"` are favoured over the legacy ones such as
`"EPSG:7415"`:

For instance, for the
http://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/7415/[Dutch national CRS in
3D]:

[source,json]
----
"metadata": {
  "referenceSystem": "urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::7415"
}
----

Be aware that the CRS should be a three-dimensional one, ie the
elevation/height values should be with respect to a specific datum.

[NOTE]
Unlike in (City)GML where each object can have a different CRS (eg
a wall of a building could theoretically have a different from the other
walls used to represent the building), in CityJSON all the city objects
need to be in the same CRS.

=== Geographic Extent (bbox)

While this can be extracted from the dataset itself, it is useful to
store it. It may be stored as an array with 6 values:
`[minx, miny, minz, maxx, maxy, maxz]`

=== Lineage

It is possible to give the lineage of one or more city objects in the

reconstructed; if many were with the same method then their IDs should
simply be listed in `"featureID"`.

[NOTE]
====
JSON does not have a date type, and thus the representations
defined by https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6[RFC 3339,
Section 5.6] should be used. A simple date is `"full-date"` (thus
`"1977-07-11"` as a string), and should be used for the metadata above.

Other attributes in a CityJSON object can also have a date with a time,
and such an attribute is specified as a `"full-time"`. For example
`"1985-04-12T23:20:50.52Z"` (stored as a string).
====


== Appearance Object

Both textures and materials are supported in CityJSON, and the same
mechanisms used in CityGML are reused, so the conversion back-and-forth
is easy. The material is represented with the
http://www.web3d.org/documents/specifications/19775-1/V3.2/Part01/components/shape.html#Material[X3D]
specifications, as is the case for CityGML. For the texture, the
https://www.khronos.org/collada/[COLLADA standard] is reused, as is the
case for CityGML. However:

* the CityGML class `GeoreferencedTexture` is not supported.
* the CityGML class `TexCoordGen` is not supported, ie one must specify
the UV coordinates in the texture files.
* the major difference is that in CityGML each Material/Texture object
keeps a list of the primitives using it, while in CityJSON it is the
opposite: if a primitive has a Material/Texture then it is stated with
the primitive (with a link to it).

An Appearance Object is a JSON object that

* may have one member with the name `"materials"`, whose value is an
array of Material Objects.
* may have one member with the name `"textures"`, whose value is an
array of Texture Objects.
* may have both `"materials"` and `"textures"`.
* may have one member with the name `"vertex-texture"`, whose value is
an array of coordinates of each so-called UV vertex of the city model.
* may have one member with the name `"default-theme-texture"`, whose
value is the name of the default theme for the appearance (a string).
This can be used if geometries have more than one textures, so that a
viewer displays the default one.
* may have one member with the name `"default-theme-material"`, whose
value is the name of the default theme for the material (a string). This
can be used if geometries have more than one textures, so that a viewer
displays the default one.

=== Geometry Object having material(s)

Each surface in a Geometry Object can have one or more materials
assigned to it. To store the material of a surface, a Geometry Object
may have a member `"material"`, the value of this member is a collection
of key-value pairs, where the key is the _theme_ of the material, and
the value is one JSON object that must contain either:

* one member `"values"`, whose value is a hierarchy of arrays with
integers. Each integer refers to the position (0-based) in the
`"materials"` member of the `"appearance"` member of the CityJSON
object. If a surface has no material, then `null` should be used in the
array. The depth of the array depends on the Geometry object, and is
equal to the depth of the `"boundary"` array minus 2, because each
surface (`[[]]`) gets one material.
* one member `"value"`, whose value is one integer referring to the
position (0-based) in the `"materials"` member of the `"appearance"`
member of the CityJSON object. This is used because often the materials
are used to colour full objects, and repetition of materials is not
necessary.

In the following, the Solid has 4 surfaces, and there are 2 themes
("irradiation" and "irradiation-2"). These could represent, for
instance, the different colours based on different scenarios of an solar
irradiation analysis. Notice that the last surface gets no material (for
both themes), thus `null` is used.

  "type": "Solid",
  "lod": 2,
  "boundaries": [
    [ [[0, 3, 2, 1]], [[4, 5, 6, 7]], [[0, 1, 5, 4]], [[1, 2, 6, 5]] ] 
  ],
  "material": {
    "irradiation": { 
      "values": [[0, 0, 1, null]] 
    },
    "irradiation-2": { 
      "values": [[2, 2, 1, null]] 
    }
  }
}
----

=== Geometry Object having texture(s)

To store the texture(s) of a surface, a Geometry Object may have a
member with the value `"texture"`, its value is a collection of
key-value pairs, where the key is the _theme_ of the textures, and the
value is one JSON object that must contain one member `"values"`, whose
value is a hierarchy of arrays with integers. For each ring of each
surface, the first value refers to the position (0-based) in the
`"textures"` member of the `"appearance"` member of the CityJSON object.
The other indices refer to the UV positions of the corresponding
vertices (as listed in the `"boundaries"` member of the geometry). Each
array representing a ring therefore has one more value than that to
store its vertices.

The depth of the array depends on the Geometry object, and is equal to
the depth of the `"boundary"` array.

In the following, the Solid has 4 surfaces, and there are 2 themes:
"winter-textures" and "summer-textures" could for instance represent
the textures during winter and summer.. Notice that the last 2 surfaces
of the first theme gets no material, thus `null` is used.

=== Material Object

A Material Object:

* must have one member with the name `"name"`, whose value is a string
identifying the material.
* may have the following members (their meaning is explained

[arabic]
. `"ambientIntensity"`, whose value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0
. `"diffuseColor"`, whose value is an array with 3 numbers between 0.0
and 1.0 (RGB colour)
. `"emissiveColor"`, whose value is an array with 3 numbers between 0.0
and 1.0 (RGB colour)
. `"specularColor"`, whose value is an array with 3 numbers between 0.0
and 1.0 (RGB colour)
. `"shininess"`, whose value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0
. `"transparency"`, whose value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (1.0
being completely transparent)
. `"isSmooth"`, whose value is a Boolean value, is defined in CityGML as
a hint for normal interpolation. If this boolean flag is set to true,
vertex normals should be used for shading (Gouraud shading). Otherwise,
normals should be constant for a surface patch (flat shading).

A Texture Object:

* must have one member with the name `"type"`, whose value is a string
with either "PNG" or "JPG" as value
* must have one member with the name `"image"`, whose value is a string
with the name of the file. This file can be a URL (eg
`"http://www.hugo.com/filename.jpg"`), a relative path (eg
`"appearances/myroof.jpg"`), or an absolute path (eg
`"/home/elvis/mycityjson/appearances/myroof.jpg"`).
* may have one member with the name `"wrapMode"`, whose value can be any
of the following: `"none"`, `"wrap"`, `"mirror"`, `"clamp"`, or
`"border"`.
* may have one member with the name `"textureType"`, whose value can be
any of the following: `"unknown"`, `"specific"`, or `"typical"`.

validate the data model, schemas should be seen as basically validating
the syntax of a JSON document.

A CityJSON _Extension_ is a JSON file that allows us to document how the
core data model of CityJSON may be extended, and to validate CityJSON
files. This is conceptually akin to the _Application Domain Extensions_
(ADEs) in CityGML; see Section 10.13 of the
https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=47842[official
CityGML documentation].

The following 3 cases for extension are possible:

[arabic]
. Adding new complex attributes to existing City Objects
. Adding new properties at the root of a document
. Creating a new City Object, or "extending" one, and defining complex
geometries

[NOTE]
====
While Extensions are less flexible than CityGML ADEs (inheritance
and namespaces are for instance not supported, and less customisation is
possible), it should be noted that the flexibility of ADEs comes at a
price: the software processing an extended CityGML file will not
necessarily know what structure to expect. There is ongoing work to use
the ADE schemas to automatically do this, but this currently is not
supported by most software. Viewers might not be affected by ADEs
because the geometries are usually not changed by an ADE. However,
software parsing the XML to extract attributes and features might not
work directly (and thus specific code would need to be written).

CityJSON Extensions are designed such that they can be read and
processed by standard CityJSON software, often no changes in the parsing
code is required. This is achieved by enforcing a set of simple rules,
as defined below, when adding new City Objects. If these are followed,
then a CityJSON file containing Extensions will be seen as a
"standard" CityJSON file.
====


=== Using an Extension in a CityJSON file

An Extension should be given a name (eg "Noise") and the URL of the
Extension file should be given, along with the version that is used for
this file. It is expected that the Extension is publicly available at
the URL, and can be downloaded.

Several Extensions can be used in a single file, each one is indexed by
its name in the `"extensions"` JSON object. In the example below we have
2 Extensions: one named "Noise" and one named "Solar_Potential".

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "CityJSON",
  "version": "1.0",
  "extensions": {
    "Noise": {
      "url" : "https://someurl.org/noise.json",
      "version": "1.0"
    },
    "Solar_Potential": {
      "url" : "https://someurl.org/solar.json",
      "version": "0.8"
    }
  },
  "CityObjects": {},
  "vertices": []
}
----

=== The Extension file

A CityJSON Extension is a JSON object, and it must have the following 7
members:

[arabic]
. one member with the name `"type"`, whose value must be
`"CityJSON_Extension"`;
. one member with the name `"name"`, whose value must be a string
identifying the extension;
. one member with the name `"uri"`, whose value must be a string with
the URI of the location of the schema where the JSON object is located;
. one member with the name `"version"`, whose value must be a string
identifying the version of the Extension;
. one member with the name `"extraRootProperties"`, whose value must be
a JSON object; its content is part of a JSON schema (explained below),
or an empty object;
. one member with the name `"extraAttributes"`, whose value must be a
JSON object; its content is part of a JSON schema (explained below), or
an empty object;
. one member with the name `"extraCityObjects"`, whose value must be a
JSON object; its content is part of a JSON schema (explained below), or
an empty object;

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "CityJSON_Extension",
  "name": "Noise",
  "uri": "https://someurl.org/noise.json",
  "version": "0.1",
  "description": "Extension to model the noise"
  "extraRootProperties": {},     
  "extraAttributes": {},
  "extraCityObjects": {}
}
----

A CityJSON Extension object must be in a standalone file and it must be
located in a folder `/extensions` in the folder where the CityJSON
schemas are located. For a new extension `noise.json` the following
structure would result:

[source,console]
----
|-- appearance.schema.json
|-- cityjson.schema.json
|-- cityobjects.schema.json
|-- geomprimitives.schema.json
|-- geomtemplates.schema.json
|-- metadata.schema.json
|-- /extensions
    |-- noise.json
----

This also means that if an element of the Extension reuses or references
structures defined in the schemas of CityJSON, then the relative path
`../` must be used. An example would be to reuse the Solid type would
be:

[source,json]
----
"items": {
  "oneOf": [
    {"$ref": "../geomprimitives.json#/Solid"}
  ]
}
----

=== Case 1: Adding new complex attributes to existing City Objects

One of the philosophies of JSON is "schema-less", which means that one
is allowed to define new properties for the JSON objects without
documenting them in a JSON schema (watch out: this does _not_ mean that
JSON cannot have schemas!). While this is in contrast to CityGML (and
GML as a whole) where the schemas are central, the schemas of CityJSON
(schema) are partly following that philosophy. That is, for a given City
Object, the "allowed" properties/attributes are listed in the schema,
but it is not an error to add new ones. The "official validator" of
CityJSON (https://github.com/cityjson/cjio[cjio] with the option
`--validate`) does more than simply validate a dataset against the
schemas, and will return a _warning_ if an attribute is not in the
schema, but it is not considered as invalid in CityJSON.

In brief, if one wants to simply add a new attribute to a given
`"Building"`, say to document its colour (`"colour": "red"`), the
easiest way is just to add a property to the City Object (notice that
`"storeysAboveGround"` is an allowed attributes to buildings):

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "Building", 
  "attributes": { 
    "storeysAboveGround": 2,
    "colour": "red"
  },
  "geometry": [...]
}
----

It is also possible to add, and document in a schema, complex
attributes, for example if we wanted to have the colour of the buildings
as a RGBA value (red-green-blue-alpha):

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "Building", 
  "attributes": { 
    "storeysAboveGround": 2,
    "+colour": {
      "rgba": [255, 255, 255, 1],
    },
  },
  "geometry": [...]
}
----

Another example would be to store the area of the parcel of a building,
and also to document the unit of measurement (UoM):

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "Building", 
  "attributes": { 
    "storeysAboveGround": 2,
    "+area-parcel": {
      "value": 437,
      "uom": "m2"
    } 
  },
  "geometry": [...]
}
----

For these 2 cases, the CityJSON Extension object would look like the
snippet below. Notice that `"extraAttributes"` may have several
properties (the types of the City Objects are the possibilities) and
then each of these have as properties the new attributes (there can be
several).

An extra attribute must start with a `"+"`; notice that it is good
practice to prepend the attribute with the name of the Extension, to
avoid that 2 attributes from 2 different extensions have the same name.

The value of the property is a JSON schema, this schema can reference
and reuse JSON objects already defined in the CityJSON schemas.

[source,json]
----
"extraAttributes": {
  "Building": {
    "+colour": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "rgba": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {"type": "number"},
          "minItems": 4,    
          "maxItems": 4
        }
      },
      "required": ["rgba"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    },
    "+area-parcel": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "value": { "type": "number" },
        "uom": { "type": "string", "enum": ["m2", "feet2"] }
      },
      "required": ["value", "uom"],
      "additionalProperties": false
    }      
  } 
}
----

=== Case 2: Adding new properties at the root of a document

It is allowed to add a new property at the root of a CityJSON file, but
if one wants to document it in a schema, then this property must start
with a `"+"`. Imagine we wanted to store some census data for a given
neighbourhood for which we have a CityJSON file, then we could define
the extra root property `"+census"` as follows:

[source,json]
----
"extraRootProperties": {
  "+census": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "percent_men": { 
        "type": "number",
        "minimum": 0.0,
        "maximum": 100.0
      },
      "percent_women": { 
        "type": "number",
        "minimum": 0.0,
        "maximum": 100.0
      }
    }
  }
}
----

And a CityJSON file would look like this:

[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "CityJSON",
  "version": "1.0",
  "extensions": {
    "MyExtension": {
      "url" : "https://someurl.org/myextension.json",
      "version": "1.0"
    }
  },
  "CityObjects": {...},
  "vertices": [...],
  "+census": {
    "percent_men": 49.5,
    "percent_women": 51.5
  }
}
----

=== Case 3: Creating/extending new City Objects

The creation of a new City Object is done by defining it in the CityJSON
Extension object in the `"extraCityObjects"` property:

[source,json]
----
"extraCityObjects": {
  "+NoiseBuilding": {
    "allOf": [
      { "$ref": "../cityobjects.json#/_AbstractBuilding" },
      {
        "properties": {
          "type": { "enum": ["+NoiseBuilding"] },
          "toplevel": {"type": "boolean"},
          "attributes": {
            "properties": {
              "buildingLDenMin": {"type": "number"}
            }
          }
        },
        "required": ["type"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
----

Since all City Objects are documented in the schemas of CityJSON (in
https://github.com/cityjson/specs/tree/master/schemas[cityobjects.json]),
it is basically a matter of copying the parts needed in a new file and
modifying its content.

A new name for the City Object must be given and it must begin with a
`"+"`.

Because City Objects can be of different levels (1st-level ones can
exist by themselves; 2nd-level ones need to have a parent), we need to
explicitly state this by using the property `"toplevel"`, which is a
Boolean value.

Please note that since JSON schemas do not allow inheritance, the only
way to extend a City Object is to define an entirely new one (with a new
name, eg `"+NoiseBuilding"`). This is done by copying the schema of the
parent City Object and extending it.

=== Rules to follow to define new City Objects

The challenge when creating Extensions to the core model is that we do
not want to break the software packages (viewers, spatial analysis, etc)
that already read and process CityJSON files. While one could define a
new City Object and document it, if this new object does not follow the
rules below then it will mean that new specific software needs to be
built for itâ€”this would go against the fundamental ideas behind
CityJSON.

[arabic]
. The name of a new City Object must begin with a `"+"`, eg
`"+NoiseBuilding"`.
. A new City Object must conform to the rules of CityJSON, ie it must
contain a property `"type"` and one `"geometry"`. If the object contains
appearances, the same mechanism should be used so that the new City
Objects can be processed without modification.
. A new City Object must contain the property `"toplevel"`, whose value
is a Boolean (true = 1st-level; false = 2nd-level).
. All the geometries must be in the property `"geometry"`, and cannot be
located somewhere else deep in a hierarchy of a new property. This
ensures that all the code written to process, manipulate, and view
CityJSON files will be working without modifications.
. If a new City Object contains other objects and requires different
geometries, then a new City Object needs to be defined using the
parent-children structure of CityJSON, as used by `"Building"` and
`"BuildingPart"`.
. The reuse of types defined in CityJSON, eg `"Solid"` or semantic
surfaces, is allowed.
. To define a new semantic surface, a `+` must be prepended to its name,
eg `"+ThermalSurface"`.
