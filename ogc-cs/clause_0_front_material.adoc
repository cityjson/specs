[big]*iii.   Preface*


Note that this document requires a good knowledge of the OGC City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) Encoding Standard (https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=47842[OGC document #12-019]), as this document reuses the terminology and follows the data model presented in CityGML.

CityJSON v1.0 implements most of the CityGML v2.0.0 data model, and all the CityGML modules have been mapped to CityJSON objects.
However, for the sake of simplicity and efficiency, some modules and features have been omitted and/or simplified.
The differences in the structure of the modules were made to improve the usability of CityJSON in practice, all decisions were made so that developers can easily manipulate files.

CityJSON v1.0 is thus conformant to a subset of CityGML v2.0.0, and the main features that are not supported are:

  1. Interior of buildings and bridges are not allowed (LoD4);
  2. `ExternalReferences`, that is all features should be in the same file;
  3. Several CRSs in the same datasets;
  4. Identifiers for low-level geometries.
  5. ADEs have been replaced by _Extensions_ and have been simplified;

The exhaustive list of the differences between the CityJSON v1.0 implementation and CityGML v2.0.0 is available https://www.cityjson.org/citygml-compatibility[in this webpage].
